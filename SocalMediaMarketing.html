                <p>Social media marketing has emerged as a powerful tool for businesses. It enables businesses to create content that catches the eye of customers at first glance. This encourages purchases and sharing, two of the most effective ways to promote a business. Besides generating direct sales, social media also creates word-of-mouth advertising, which reaches previously unreachable audiences and carries implicit endorsement.</p>
